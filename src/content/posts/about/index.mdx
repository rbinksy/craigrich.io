I'm a developer living in London, UK. I work at Credit Karma.

I studied computer science at Lancaster, spent my early years playing volleyball and later developed a passion for JavaScript and Web development.

I got my first full-time job as a frontend engineer in 2012 and relocated to London. I was part of the initial engineering team at Seed, and then left to freelance for various clients across the UK.

I joined Credit Karma in 2022 as a product engineer to help people access credit. I try to broaden my understanding of technology and enjoy thinking about frontend problems at scale.

I walk my dog in Richmond Park most days and partial to Belgian ale. If you would like to chat you can send me an [email](mailto:craig.rich@hotmail.co.uk).
