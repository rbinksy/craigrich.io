Suppose I want to display something on your screen. Whether I want to display a web page like this blog post, an interactive web app, or even a native app that you might download from some app store, at least _two_ devices must be involved.

It starts with some code and data on _my_ device. For example, I am editing this blog post as a file on my laptop. If you see it on your screen, it must have already traveled from my device to yours. At some point, somewhere, my code and data turned into the HTML and JavaScript instructing _your_ device to display this.

So how does that relate to React? React is a UI programming paradigm that lets me break down _what_ to display (a blog post, a signup form, or even a whole app) into independent pieces called _components_, and compose them like LEGO blocks. I'll assume you already know and like components; check [react.dev](https://react.dev) for an intro.

Components are code, and that code has to run somewhere. But wait--_whose_ computer should they run on? Should they run on your computer? Or on mine?

Let's make a case for each side.

First, I'll argue that components should run on _your_ computer.

Give it some thought, and next time we'll compare our notes../post-preview.jsx
